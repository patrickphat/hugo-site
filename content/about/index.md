I'm Patrick Phat, an AI enthusiast, an optimist and a teamplayer. I'm currently working as an AI Research Engineer at [Cinnamon AI](https://cinnamon.is/en/), working on  reducing AI Researcher engineering efforts and speeding up experimenting loops.

Previously, at the end of 2018, I had my first teaching job at [Topica Native](https://topicanative.edu.vn/) as a English Tutor, the job let me connect and help thousands of people from all walks of life improve their English professionally.

Throughout 2019, I worked at [HasBrain](http://www.hasbrain.com/) as a programming mentor. I founded 2 "Introduction to Python courses" and teaching assist to a data scientist in "Introduction to Data Analytics" course, helping people from diverse non-tech backgrounds break into programming.

In 2020, I joined [Cinnamon AI](https://cinnamon.is/en/)'s bootcamp and luckily got my first internship at this company as an AI Research Engineer.

During time in college, I'm a Vice President of [Open English Club](https://www.facebook.com/oeclub.uit) - a public university English language club, hosting a lot of events to help university enhance engagement and their English skills.

I also founded the [VietCS community](https://www.vietcs.org/), the blogging platform for Vietnamese Computer Science enthusiasts.
